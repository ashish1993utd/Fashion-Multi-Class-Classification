# Fashion-Multi-Class-Classification-Deep-Learnin

- The Global Fashion Industry is valued at 3 trillion dollars and accounts for 2% for world's GDP.

- Fashion industry is undergoing a dramatic tranformation by adopting new computer vision and machine learning and deep learning techniques.

- I was intrigued with Amazon's Echo look style assistant and its power what it can do with images. So in order to get a taste of Deep learning, and to scratch the surface of Artificial Intelligence a bit, I decided to work on a fashion dataset.

- Using Deep learning I wanted to build a virtual style assistant, which gets a picture from a website or social media or something and categorizes it into what fashion good/category is a person wearing. 

- Not to give you any false hopes, I haven't build a virtual assistant in this project. But have only made myself familier how the classification of images is done. Because image data is not like any other numerical data, an image is converted into a matrix of pixels and then those pixels and converted into raw data which can be fed into a model so that classification can be done.

- We cannot treat images like any other feature or data samples, we need to preserve the spatial dependence between pixels when dealing with image data. like in an image, each pixel depends on the pixels around it

- For now I have learnt to process Grayscale images and classify them into on of the target categories.

<b>Future Goals </b>
- To classify images that are richer in information, that also take into account the color, shape, style, texture and fabric of a fashion item.

- To build a Virtual syle assistant can help in forecasting fashion trends and launch targetted marketing campaigns.

- Code for model improvization is available on demand
